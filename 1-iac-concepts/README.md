# What is infrastructure lifecycle?

A number of clearly defined and distinct work phases which are used by DevOps engineers to *plan*, *design*, *build*, *test*, *deliver*, *mantain* and *retire* cloud infrastructure.

## What is Day 0, Day 1 and Day 2?

- Day 0 - Plan and Design
- Day 1 - Develop and Iterate
- Day 2 - Go live and mantain

> Days do not literally mean a 24 hour days and is just a broad way of defining where a infrastructure project would be.
